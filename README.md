# Game of Life GUI
GUI implementation of Conway's Game of Life using JavaFX.
To run the GUI, run the GridPaneEx.
## About the Game Board
The grid size is 25x25, and the cells cells are wrapped so that the first cells in the top row are neighboring the cells in the bottom row, and the cells in the left column are neighboring the cells in the right column. Black cells represent cells which are living, and white cels represent cells that are dead. The game board is automatically initialized randomly, and the *Step* button computes the state of the cells in the next step. The *Reset* button randomly initializes the cells of the board.
